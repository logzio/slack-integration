# Alice: Logz.io chat app for Slack

Alice is a Slack chat app that gives you access to your data in Logz.io. If youâ€™re signed up for our Enterprise plan, you get the full power of Alice.

With Alice, you can:
* Run an ElasticSearch query
* Get Kibana objects, snapshots, dashboards, visualizations, and saved searches
* See your alert definitions
* View triggered alerts

You can chat with the Alice in a group message (where you'll need to tag `@Alice`) or in a private message.

## Install Alice

Install the Alice app from the [Slack App Directory](#).

Alice works with the Logz.io API, so you'll need an Enterprise plan. Sign up for a free trial at [https://logz.io](https://logz.io).
