# Alice: Logz.io chat app for Slack

Alice is a Slack app that gives you access to your data in Logz.io.

With Alice, you can:
* Run an Elasticsearch query
* Get Kibana objects, snapshots, dashboards, visualizations, and saved searches
* See your alert definitions
* View triggered alerts

Chat with Alice in a group message (where you'll need to tag `@Alice`) or in a private message.

Read more about Alice in the [Logz.io Docs](https://docs.logz.io/user-guide/integrations/alice-slack-chatbot.html).

## Install Alice

Alice works with the Logz.io API, so you'll need an Enterprise or Pro plan.

### Create API tokens

You'll need an API token for each Logz.io account you want Alice to access:

* For Enterprise plans, [create an API token](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/settings/api-tokens) in Logz.io
* For Pro plans, request an API token from [help@logz.io](help@logz.io)

### Add an account

To add an account, type `@Alice add account`.
Keep an API token handyâ€”you'll need to provide one here.
You'll also need to give an alias for the account.

## Using Alice

Talk to Alice in a private conversation or group conversations.
If you're in a group conversation, remember to tag `@Alice`.
